## How To Build / Mod (etc.)

### Setup

- Download the mono version of [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) 3.5 (below 4.0 and not Android)
- Download and install dependencies listed on download page if you haven't already
- Download [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1) and install it if you haven't already
- Download the Run Diggy, Run! source code
- Import the Run Diggy, Run! .zip or project.godot file into Godot Game Engine.

### After Setup

If you have no experience with the Godot Game Engine or programming, without editing code, you can change assets such as: images, audio, collision shapes, and more. It is recommended to learn the basics of programming.

One thing you should know regardless of experience is that for this project I use Visual Studio Code for development. This is because I can use C# and GDScript in the same code editor (by downloading and configuring the [godot-tools](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin) plugin in Visual Studio Code and Godot Game Engine).

## Notes

There may be some major bugs because this is my first game I've made that's not a web game in Scratch and I will try to fix them if documented. This game is also not optimized because rather than trying to create an optimal product, I tried to focus on the creative aspect (art, music, etc.) more than optimal code.
